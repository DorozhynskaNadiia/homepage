			<h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
			<p itemprop="description">hanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San, and his brother is Eros of Titan, also known as Starfox. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him, due to believing that her son would annihilate every life in the universe, but was stopped by A'Lars, Thanos' father. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. </p>
			
			<p>By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death.[13] As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.</p>
